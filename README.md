# Compiler with Socket and Threads

This is a Python compiler that uses sockets and threads to provide efficient communication between the client and server. The compiler is designed to asynchronously compile source code and return results to the client.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Compilation:** The implementation uses threads to allow the asynchronous compilation of code, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

- **Socket Communication:** Communication between the client and server is performed through sockets, providing efficient communication and facilitating integration in networks.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compiler-socket-thread.git
   cd compiler-socket-thread
   ```
## Running the project

1. Run the server:
   
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   
2. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```
### Work in progress:
  1. Talking about the compiler and about his nature
